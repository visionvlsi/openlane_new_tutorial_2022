In VLSI physical design, diode insertion is a technique used to improve the reliability and robustness of the design by adding diodes to the circuit.

Diode insertion involves adding diodes between certain circuit nodes to limit the voltage swings and prevent overvoltage conditions. The diodes are inserted in such a way that they do not interfere with the original circuit function but provide additional protection against voltage spikes.

The purpose of diode insertion is to prevent voltage breakdowns and latch-up effects that can occur due to various factors such as electrostatic discharge (ESD), power supply noise, and radiation. These effects can cause permanent damage to the circuit and degrade its performance or reliability.

Diode insertion is commonly used in the design of integrated circuits for applications that require high reliability, such as automotive, aerospace, and medical devices. The technique can also be applied during physical design optimization to improve the robustness of the design without significantly impacting the performance or area.

In summary, diode insertion is a technique used in VLSI physical design to improve the reliability and robustness of the circuit by adding diodes to limit voltage swings and prevent overvoltage conditions.
